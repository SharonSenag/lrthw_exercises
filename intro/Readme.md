>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Reading and Writing

Attention to Detail

Spotting Differences

>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and Writing:  Typing and running code samples helps in learning the names of the symbols, makes them become familiar from typing them, and increases the comfort of reading the Ruby language.

Attention to Detail: Important part of becoming a good programmer, making for clean programs rather than programs riddled with bugs and difficulty.

Spotting Differences:  A skill developed over time that helps train programmers to notice mistakes, bugs, and other problems.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Copy and pasting takes away the effectiveness of lessons.  

Better to type every line so as to train a progammers hands, brain, and mind in how to read, write, and see code.

>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. 

If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.
